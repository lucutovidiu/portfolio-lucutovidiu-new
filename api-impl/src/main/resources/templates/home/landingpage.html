                        Starting since I was about 7 by that time there wasn't too many
                        computers, but the first time I've seen one on TV made me fall in
                        love with..., a few years later I've got my first computer at home
                        and I was very very pleased. I have started programming in High
                        School and always continued to study and programming. Then I went
                        to the University and continued with programming and really loved
                        learning about new technologies and frameworks. I'm really keen on
                        getting better and better. Recently like 3 years ago I've started with
                        developing in javascript with node and React, but about a year ago I've
                        started intensively with Angular 2 and Java on backend, I absolutely love both.

                        In the High School I've started Programing in Pascal with Visual
                        Fox Pro as a database, it was a good brake into Programing. Then
                        after in the University I've started hard into Programming
                        starting with C and than C++, I used to use them to make daemon
                        servers that do communication with a website or multi threading
                        apps, I did love them... But the most I loved was Java,
                        and of course more different technoloies and frameworks.
                        Recently from about 3 years I've started hard on web programming
                        in which I see big potential. So at the moment I work in my company as
                        a Angular / Java programmer, on backend I we use Kafka as messaging service,
                        as well as docker on daily basis, doing tests on java with JUnit and Mokito using as well
                        sonarqube, also
                        using Git daily which I master, we are developing in a Linux based environment
                        sometines doing linux different scripts. below are tech I use: &nbsp;
                        <span class="font-weight-bold small">
                HTML, CSS / SCSS, JAVASCRIPT / ANGULAR / REACT, JAVA EE / Spring Boot,
                NODE / EXPRESS, MySql, MongoDB / GraphQL, Kafka, Git, Docker and Frameworks them.
